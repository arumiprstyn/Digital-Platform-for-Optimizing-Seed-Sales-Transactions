# 🌱 SeedBridge

**Digital Platform for Optimizing Seed Sales Transactions**
*(Academic Project – Database Systems & Programming Algorithms)*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**SeedBridge** is a digital information system designed to optimize seed sales transactions between **PT. Benih Citra Asia** and local farmers in **Jember**.
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment for **Database Systems** and **Programming Algorithms** courses.

The system aims to improve transaction efficiency, data accuracy, and transparency by managing seed product data, farmer data, and sales transactions in a structured and reliable way.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Design a **relational database system** for seed sales transactions
* Implement **basic programming logic and algorithms** to support system operations
* Apply **database normalization and data integrity rules**
* Simulate a real-world **information system** used by agribusiness companies

---

## 🏢 Case Study Background

PT. Benih Citra Asia distributes agricultural seed products to farmers in Jember.
The traditional transaction process often faces challenges such as:

* Manual record-keeping
* Inconsistent transaction data
* Difficulty tracking sales history and stock

**SeedBridge** was proposed as a digital solution to bridge the company and farmers through a centralized information system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Tools**:

  * Visual Studio Code
  * Draw.io (ERD Design)
  * Git & GitHub

---

## 🧩 System Features

* Farmer data management
* Seed product and stock management
* Sales transaction recording
* Transaction history tracking
* Basic reporting (total sales, stock usage)

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

### 🔹 Main Entities

* Farmers
* Seed Products
* Transactions
* Transaction Details

## ⚙️ Programming Logic & Algorithms

The system implements basic programming concepts such as:

* Conditional statements
* Looping
* Functions
* Simple transaction calculations

## 🔍 Data Integrity & Validation

* Primary and foreign key constraints
* Stock validation to prevent negative inventory
* Transaction consistency through structured input
